Lesson 1: Welcome & Overview

Multiple choice, 65 questions, 90 minutes, $200, $100 retake - 60% pass mark - no aids.


Lesson 2: Email Marketing Best Practices  15%
===============================================


6 CAN Spam requirements
-------

1) identify sender in header information

2) subject must accurately represent content of email

3) identify message as advertisement, unless you have express consent opt-in from the subscriber

4) include physical mailing address

5) provide Opt-out mechanism. Cannot be by visiting more than 1 page

6) Unsubscribe requests must be processed promptly, within 10 days.  Unsubscribe links must be operation for at least 30 days after mailing.



Improving Deliverability
--------
1) Have permission to send to subscribers

2) Monitor bounce rate, take action if a send has a bounce rate of >20%

3) Ensure subscribers can see who the email is from.  For example add name of organization to the subject line or 
recognizable from name and address

4) Purge old/active addresses

5) Manage frequency and content

6) Authenticate the email to avoid the junk folder - DomainKeys, Sender ID, SPF (Sender Policy Framework)



Acquistion Process
------

1) Website sigup, forms, single or double (email confirmation) signup
2) Facebook
3) Mobile opt in
4) Store check out
5) Call centers


- Don't force people
- make sign up forms prominent
- keep form short

Incentives deliver to the email provided, and not overly rich incentives


Onboarding - signup confirmation, welcome email series

Tell the subscribers the number of emails to be expected

Content - convey message when images are blocked, use personalization, dynamic content, and good default content


=================================================
Lesson 3: Email Message Design 13%
=================================================
(Best Practices, Testing, and Approvals)

Design for top 600 pixels & 3 inches
Make links stand out - underline bold
Less images, less copy
personlize
make Unsub easy
Avoid CSS
minimize use of spam words

test subject line, use optimized subject line
trust worthy from name
relevant content and hierarchy and optimized for images off
Make email actionable in any environment, and a Clear call to action


Mobile Aware vs  Responsive design

MA - uses design only tactics using small improvements to enhance desktop & mobile viewing.  Often single-column layout

RD - often multiple versions of email rendering nicely and differently on all devices.  Layout is often different.


A/B Testing tool capabilities
==============================
- test 2 versions of the email to 2 different audiences, which is based on highest unique opens or clicks
- The system will automatically split the audiences into 2 for A/B testing.  There will be the first "test" Audience. Typically a smaller % of the 
  total, and the remaining subscribers will be in the second Audience (to receive the winning email.)
- The system (NOT the test admin) RANDOMLY chooses which subscribers will be placed in each audience (test & winning)

- The test administrator selects a % or fixed number of subscribers from the total for each of the (test & winning) audiences
  
- A/B testing can be used to test the following:

	- subject, from name, send date/time, content areas, preheaders, 




Testing Tools
==============

Content Detective - uses spam filter to identify spam trigger words

Validation - checks for field syntax (personalization strings spelling), dyn content rules, AMPScripts, unsub link, physical address

Send Preview - indiviual content will be populated based on data

Test Send - send to 5 recipients, personalization DOES NOT populate, not all links are active.


Email Approval
==============
Enabling Approvals will allow you to review and approve emails. Unapproved emails can be edited, and only approved emails can be sent.

This feature needs to be enabled by an admin.  Go to Administration -> Applications -> Approvals  (Toggle on/off switch)
4 states: Draft, Pending  Approval, Declined, Approved

There types of sends can be approved:
Scheduled Sends
A/B Tests
Automations
Triggered Sends

Microsites
==========
A microsite is a collection of one or more landing pages hosted in your account. Use a microsite to contain information beyond what you include in an email. For example, you can create a microsite to contain a lead-generation form, an opt-in subscriber form, or to direct subscribers to more information about a corporate initiative.

Landing Pages
=============
The landing pages interface presents a simplified version of the microsites interface. Landing pages lack this microsites functionality:

Custom content types; limited content types are available in landing pages
Custom landing page templates
Search parameters
Archive
Authentication Options

Lesson 4: Content Creation & Delivery 18%
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

7 objectives

1) Ways to customize email messages
		personalization strings 
		dynamic content
		AMPScript or Guide Template Language


2) Identify the optimal ways to customize an email message
	- Content Builder
	- Template Based
	- HTML Paste
	- Text Only
	- Unprocessed HTML Paste
	- Unprocessed Text Only
	- Simple Automated Email


3) Describe the tools to construct email messages
	- Content Canvas allows you to create and store content for use across all channels
	
	- The process of creating an email starts with choosing the type of email you would like to create:
	  You can create either Content Builder Emails or Classic Content Emails
	  NOTE: Classic content is no longer supported starting in January 2019. 
	  Use Content Builder to manage, create, and edit content.
	
	- Classic Content has the following Tree view sub menu:
		
		- My Emails
			
			- you can create a new Email (mailing) from one of these options: Template Based, HTML Paste, or Text Only
				 
				- specify the Email name, description, 
				- target language (this is the encoding like UTF-8 not en or fr) 
				- location (tree view folder hierarchy)
				- subject, preheader, campaign (used to organize/group mailings)
				
				- If Template Based (select Template from the My Templates section)
				- Upon saving, there will be a "Send" button where you can pick, Guided Send, Simple Send, Test Send
				- Guided and Simple sends will allow you to pick the recipient list, FROM options, and SEND Options, see details below.
				- Test Send is just for testing, not deployment, see details below.
				
				
		- My Templates
			- create resuable templates.  Typically used to ensure emails follow certain design/layout standards.
		
		- Portfolio
			- Image management
		
		- My Contents
		
			- Content
				- static content, can be text only, html, or image
			
			- Dynamic Content
				- rule based content. rule is a search condition on a data attribute. Must specify default content if the rule condition is not met.
				- IF (rule==true) display some_content ELSE display some_default_content.
			
			- A/B Test Content
				- specify a name, select Content for version A, and select Content for version B.
		
		- My Microsites
			
		
	- Content Builder (this is the new Content Builder, aimed at simplifying the email creation, testing, and sending experience)
		- it is a cross-channel content editor that was built on CKEditor, an open source WYSIWYG editor
		
		- Template Based: 
			Choose this option if you already have a template that you're using for this email.
		- HTML Paste: 
			Choose this option to type or paste HTML code for an email into the editor.
		- Text Only: 
			Choose this option if you want to create an email that displays as text only 
			in your subscribers' inbox regardless of their display preferences. Opens data is never reported for text-only emails.


4) Three (3) different ways to send: 

	Simple Send - basic one page send screen, the page provides options to select:
				- the recipient LIST or Subscriber GROUP (no option to select from DE or Audience)
					Note: A Subscriber Group allows you to create a Filtered Group (based on profile/preference attributes) or Random Group
				- FROM options and SEND Options (same as in Guided send below)
	Guided Send - multi screen wizard that guides you through necessary steps to send your email.
				- you can select recipients from a List, Data extension, Data filter, OR an Audience (has to be 1 as they are radio buttons). 
				- However, you can select multiple sources (for example, 2 different DEs)
				- select exclusion lists, suppression lists, publication lists
				- select FROM options (from name and address OR pick a send classification)
				- select SEND Options (Link tracking, suppress this send from reports, enable send logging to data extension, send email to test address)
				- You can schedule to send at a given time or send immediately.  The is no option to configure a recurring send with GUIDED-SEND.
	
	
	Test Send   - This is just for testing, not real deployment. It allows you to test email rendering, layout, and copy with up to 5 email addresses.
				- To test personalization, dynamic content, and/or AMPScript, use Send Preview.
				- It is possible to use Test Send even before specifying the FROM options. In this case the FROM name and address will 
				  be the logged in user, Frederick Oppong.  My address was not in the All Subscribers list.  The system added it before sending the test.
	
	
	
	User-Initiated Send Definition
				- allows you to select an Email, and add settings.  It is similar to Guided send...  Afterwards, you the user, initiates the send!  You can start it immediately or schedule it to start at a future date.
				- the point here is that, the send is initiated by the user.
	
	Simple Automated Send: Email is scheduled to be sent at a set time and date.  For example a birthday email.

	


5) Identify the appropriate send method given the scenario


6) Describe send capabilities in the platform

	a) Email Deliverability
	
	b) Content Detective
		Checks for spam
	c) Send Preview
		A rendering of an email as it will be sent to a recipient.
	d) Inbox Preview
		Optimize your emails to appear how you want them to in each of your targeted email clients (desktop, mobile)
	e) Validation Tool
		- the presence of an unsubscribe link
		- the presence of a physical mailing address
		- correct syntax for attributes used as personalization strings (eg %%FIELDNAME%%)
		- Correct syntax is used on any AMPScript in the email code.
		- the existence of any content areas defined in the dynamic content rules. 
	f) Test Send






7) Send Classification consists of these 3 parameters that can be selected for an email job:

	1) Sender Profiles
		- from name
		- from email address (including domain):  Note: Changing the 'from address' to include a domain (@domain) without authentication in place has the potential to negatively impact delivery of your email messages. Authentication of your domain via Sender ID, SPF and/or DomainKeys leads to improved deliverability, reputation and brand protection.
		- which triggered send to be used for forwarding
		- which triggered send to be used for auto-replies
	
	2) Delivery Profiles
		- sender ip : If you do not use a private domain/ip, you select the account default. 
		- header : text at the very beginning of the document that, by default, provides a link to the email as a webpage. It does  not include the header graphic that you specify in a template.
		- footer : text at the very end of a document that contains your physical mailing address and unsubscribe link.
		
	
	3) CAN-SPAM Classification
	'Commercial' and 'Transactional' have legal meanings under the U.S. Federal CAN-SPAM Act. A Commercial email message, is 'any electronic mail 
	message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service.' 
	Commercial messages must include a mechanism to unsubscribe, the physical mailing address of the sender, and (if unsolicited) a notice 
	of advertisement. For commercial messages, we check for the presence of an unsubscribe link. 

	Transactional messages, per CAN-SPAM, are primarily emails that 'facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that 
	the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender.' Per the FTC, to be considered 'transactional' per CAN-SPAM, 
	the subject line must be transactional in nature and non-promotional. Also, the email body must present the 'transactional content' 
	prior to the commercial content. For transactional messages, we do not check for the presence of an unsubscribe. 
	If you are unsure of classification, we recommend you check 'commercial' and provide an unsubscribe link. 
	This is not legal advice. Please see your legal counsel for the proper application for your organization.




Content Block can be created in the "my content" for easy reuse or in the email directly
	Types of content blocks:
		Text
		Image
		Text + Image
		Freeform
		HTML /Guide Template language
		Dynamic Content
		A/B testing content
		Predictive Intelligence Content
		

A/B Testing
Create A/B tests to send two versions of your Email Studio communication to two test audiences from your subscriber list.

A/B testing will determine which version of your email receives the highest click-through rate 
or highest unique open rate. Then send the best performing version to your remaining subscribers.

Provide a name, description, and select the TEST TYPE.
Note TEST TYPE can be ONE OF: Subject lines, Emails, Content Areas, From Names, Send dates/times, Preheaders
Looks like you cannot test two of these at a time.  Can only pick one of these RADIO test types.


Measures
- These are subscriber subsets based on events (email activity) such as SENT, OPEN, CLICK, BOUNCE, etc.
- Measures will only evaluate the past 6 months of event data.


Templates:

Changes to a template are NOT automatically inherited in emails built from that template.
In other words, a template does not automatically affect emails created from that template.
After a template is updated, the Email using this template MUST be updated in the email properties.

Lesson 5: Marketing Automation 5%
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4 Automation tools

Playbooks
	Welcome series
	Birthday emails
	Customer Anniversaries



Journey Builder

Starts with an Entry Source.  This tells Journey Builder where customers entering this 
journey come from. Each journey must include an entry source.

Entry Sources
	- Data Extension
	- API Event
	- Audience
	- CloudPages
	- Salesforce Data
	- Event (Contact Data Events will be discontinued in the future)

Various Activities (see list below) can be dragged on the canvas to build the journey.

There are Flow Controls such as:
	Decision Split
	Random Split
	Engagement Split
	Join
	Wait
	
These can be used with other Activities such as Send SMS, Send Push, and Send Email.	




Automation Studio:
A workflow is comprised of steps and within each step are activities.
All activities within a single step run concurrently and all activities within a step 
must execute successfully before beginning the next step.  Thus MULTIPLE activities
can be added EACH STEP in the workflow.

	2 types of automation

	- scheduled and triggered
	- but they can also be run immediately
		
Activities

Data activities
	Data Extract Activity:
	======================
	This activity creates one or more zipped files for your use outside the Marketing Cloud application. 
	It can also be used to convert an XML file into a comma-delimited, tab-delimited, or pipe-delimited file for import into your account.
	
	Import File Activity:
	====================
	Import file from an FTP Location into a subscriber list or data extension. 
	The source FILE LOCATION can be an SFMC ftp location, or an External FTP server (configured under FILE LOCATIONS in the admin section)
	The destination can be a List or a DE.
	File name format, delimiters, mapping, etc can be configured.
	
	File Transfer Activity:  always involves Safehouse.
	=======================
	1) Unzip or Decrypt a file from ANY FILE LOCATION (could for SFMC FTP or External FTP). File will be placed in SFMC Safehouse.
			unzip/decrypt are checkboxes and not mandatory. Both can be left unchecked and this will just transfer a file from any FILE LOCATION into Safehouse.
	2) Transfer files from the Marketing Cloud's Safehouse, to a selected FILE LOCATION (could for SFMC FTP or External FTP).

	
	
Refresh Activities
	Filter Activity:
	Apply the logic of a data filter you select to create a group or data extension in Automation Studio. 
	Filtering subscribers or contacts makes targeting specific subscribers or contacts based on their attributes and other conditions easier.
	
	SQL Query Activity:
	Retrieve data extension or data view information using Automation Studio’s SQL Query activity, then store it in a data extension.
	
	Refresh Group:
	Use this activity to re-apply the rules in a group definition to create a subset of subscribers in a list. 
	Before you can use a group refresh activity, you must create a group definition.
	
Send Email Activity:
	Choose and configure an email message to be sent on its own or as part of one or more automations. 
	You can put it in sequence with other Automation Studio activities and schedule it for a particular date and time.
	This allows you to pick an email from the list of User Initiated Emails.

Wait Activity:
	Use this activity to cause the automation to wait for a specific period of time 
	before performing the next step.

Script Activity:
	A Server-Side JavaScript activity contains your Server-Side JavaScript and executes that 
	script when started, either on its own or as part of an automation in Automation Studio. 
	You provide the Server-Side JavaScript, a name, external key, and description to identify 
	the activity within the application interface and for API calls.
	
Verification Activity:
	Avoid unintended outcomes by verifying the data used in an Automation Studio automation.	

Report Definition:
	Use this activity to define the parameters for running a report once to be used every time 
	the report is run using the activity. You can create a report activity to run every standard 
	report available in the application, as well as custom reports in your account.
	
Send Push:
	Use this activity to initiate a Push message. You can send the Push message in an automation 
	alone or in a sequence with other activities.
	
Send SMS:

Lesson 6: Subscriber and Data Management Part 42 %
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
http://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/exacttarget/resources/solution_guides/using_a_list_versus_a_data_extension/
redirects to https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_es_list_versus_data_extension.htm&type=5

- Lists versus Data Extension

- Profile attributes, Preference Attributes, Preview Profile Center
- Subscriber key,  All Subscribers, Primary Key, Send Relationship,
- Unsubs from List versus unsub from Data Extension
- Global unsubscribe and a master unsubscribe
- Import data
- Segmentation (Groups, Measures, Data Filters, Query Activities)

- A list is a compilation of subscribers that receive your communications. You create as many lists as you want to segment your subscribers 
  so that you can target your email communications.
  Since the primary purpose of a list is to house SUBSCRIBERS, an email address field is REQUIRED.  A Subscriber_key is also required (see below)
  Fields are not created directly as part of the List.  Instead fields are created under Profile Management or Preference Management.  Fields
  created under Profile/Preference Management are automatically available for every list!  These fields can be
	-Text
	-Numeric
	-Date (note Date DOES NOT includes a time portion!).
  They can be marked as Required, Hidden, Read-only.  They can also have fixed values like "Red","Yellow","Blue".
  The Profile Center is a web page where subscribers can enter and maintain the personal information that you keep about them.
  In the profile/preference management toolbar, click Preview Profile Center, to open the web page that subscribers see.

  
  Use a List when:
	- your lists will contain 500,000 subscribers or less long-term
	- you prefer simplicity over performance
	- you do not require fast import speed
	- you plan to use a limited number of subscriber attributes
	- you use the XML API
	- you prefer to add a single new subscriber at a single time

 - A data extension is a table within the application database that contains your data. You could use a data extension to store sendable 
  subscriber data like lists or just to house relational data.  Since DEs can be used to store just relational data (not subscribers), the
  email address field is not required when creating a DE.  Unlike a List, the fields are created directly as part of the DE, and the scope
  the fields created is limited to only that DE.  Just like creating fields within a table.
  With DE, you can set the fields as: Text, Number, Date (includes time portion), Boolean, Email Address, Phone, Decimal, Locale.  One of the fields
  needs to be the PK, and you can also indicate if a field is Nullable or not.  With a Date field, you can pick "Use Current Date" as the default.
  
  Use a Data Extension when:
	- your lists are going to be greater than 500,000 subscribers
	- you support multiple subscriber data sets (with separate definitions) - basically a set of different tables (or DEs)
	- you send global messages 
	- you require fast import speeds
	- you implement triggered sends
	- you use the SOAP or REST APIs
	- you prefer a flexible subscription model

	

- Subscriber Key
  This is a system text field that is used to uniquely identify a subscriber in the entire platform.   When adding records (subscribers) to any list,
  a value MUST be entered to be used as the subscriber_key.  If the value entered happens to already exist in the platform, the record cannot be saved.  
  Again, the subscriber key UNIQUELY identifies a subscriber in the entire system.  The value is not limited in scope to one list.  It's scope is 
  all lists in the entire platform.  As a side note, an email address is also a required system field that must be supplied when adding records (subscribers)
  to a list.
  ** It is recommended NOT to use an email address in this field, but use a system generated customer ID. 


- All Subscribers 
  This is a system default list that is considered the master list of records for the account. Every subscriber in your account appears in 
  the All Subscribers list. You can add records (subscribers) directly to the All Subscribers list.
  If a subscriber is unsubscribed in the All Subscribers list, the subscriber is unsubscribed from all lists and groups. 
  When a subscriber is set back to active on the All Subscribers list the subscriber will also need to be set back to active on each list 
  and group, they would like to be active on. 
  A subscriber can be unsubscribed on lists and groups and be active on the All Subscribers lists.
  Note: In compliance with the latest  CAN-SPAM laws, every Profile Center page now includes a global opt-out option.  ***This must be an error
  since global unsubscribe unsubscribes the user from Salesforce Marketing Cloud. No Salesforce client can ever send to them.  This must be a 
  master unsubscribe to remove them from all lists in an account.
  
  ** Subscribers are automatically be added to 'All Subscriber' from a sendable data extension at send time when that data extension is used 
  as the audience.
  
- Primary Key
  This is just the unique column in the Data Extension, it is not nullable
 
- Send Relationship 
  If a DE is marked as "Sendable", you MUST specify a SEND/Subscriber relationship.
  
  This allows you to pick one of the fields from your DE and relate it to Subscribers using either the Subscriber_key or Subscriber_id.
  
  Assume you pick the Customer_Key in your DE to relate to the Subscribers using Subscriber_key, then the system will attempt to match the Customer_Key
  value to any Subscriber_key value found in the platform.  If a match is found, the record in the DE is RELATED to the Subscriber.  When the
  DE is used for a Send, the email address for the Subscriber is used.  This will be the case even if the DE contains an Email Address field.
  If there is no match found between the DE Customer_Key and the Subscribers Subscriber_key, and an email address field exist in the DE, then 
  the Send will use the email address found in the DE Email Address field.  In this case, the system will add the Customer_Key and EmailAddress from the 
  DE into the AllSubscribers list (subscriber_key and emailaddress fields) at send time.
  
  Any DE created can pick one of it's fields to relate to the subscriber_key.  
  
  Imagine this scenario:
  DE1 picks PhoneNumber as the field to relate to the subscriber key.  Sample value is 9051234567
  DE2 picks CustomerNum as the field to relate to the subscriber key.  Sample value is 9051234567
  
  If there is any list subscriber with a Subscriber key of 9051234567 in the system already prior to the creation of DE1 and DE2 above, 
  the system will consider all these 3 records as the same person!
  
  This subscriber key column allows for house-holding if the value is not email address but some internal customer ID.  Keep in mind, the purpose 
  of Subscriber Key is to allow the same email address to receive more than 1 of the same message (house-holding). If this is a concern, there are 
  ways to suppress based on email address. 
  Subscriber Key also allows users to change their email address and still retain tracking data in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.  
  Otherwise a new record would need to be created and tracking data would be lost.
  
- Unsubs from List versus unsub from Data Extension

  Unsubscribes are statuses in the Email app that is either set to Unsubscribed or Active.
  
  There are 3 types:
	List unsubscribe - applies to specific lists only
	Master unsubscribe - applies to all lists in an account (organization)
	Global unsubscribe - all of SFMC!!
  
  Typically unsubscribed status only affects sends with a Commercial type CAN-SPAM classification.  However, those with a Transactional type
  CAN-SPAM classification can also be configured to respect the unsubscribed status.

  
- Global unsubscribe and a Master unsubscribe

  A global unsubscribe is an event that occurs when a subscriber chooses to unsubscribe from every email sent from the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
  The Salesforce Marketing Cloud manages this list, so if someone globally unsubscribes, their status is changed to Unsubscribed on a global list. 
  This means that none of Salesforce clients can email that subscriber, regardless of which Organization's email send they clicked the unsubscribe link.

  A master unsubscribe is when a subscriber chooses to unsubscribe from every email sent from your company. 
  When a subscriber master unsubscribes, their status is set to Unsubscribed on all your lists as well as your master/All Subscribers list.
  For example, if a subscriber is on three of your lists and master unsubscribes from one of your emails, they'll appear Unsubscribed on all your lists.


Unsubscribe Center
<a href="%%unsub_center_url%%" alias="Unsubscribe">Unsubscribe</a>
One-Click Unsubscribe link: Automatically unsubscribes the subscriber from the list that the send originated from.  The page also
shows a link to the Subscription Center, and another link to the Profile Center.
Lastly, there is also an Unsubscribe from All button shown at the end of the page.



Subscription Center
<a href="%%subscription_center_url%%" alias="Manage Subscriptions">Manage Subscriptions</a>
User can see all the public Publication Lists, and they can check the Checkbox to subscribe or uncheck to unsubscribe from each of these 
public Publication lists available on the page.
There is also an Unsubscribe from All button show at the end of the page.


Profile Center
<a href="%%profile_center_url%%" alias="Update Profile">Update Profile</a>
User can see attributes from Profile Management and Preference Management and update them.
As always, there is also the Unsubscribe from All button show at the end of the page.


Master Unsubscribe will unsub the user from the All Subscribers list.  This unsubs them from EVERY list in the system.
TO do so, import them into the All Subscribers list and provide a value of "unsubscribed" to the Status field in the import file.
You can also use the API to import them into the All Subscribers list and provide a value of "unsubscribed" to the Status field in your Update call.


Subscribers on a Publication List
Email subscribers are added to a publication list when you send to a data extension using that publication list in Email Studio.
You can see the list of subscribers in a publication list by opening the publication list located under my subscribers. 
Import subscribers into a publication list using an import activity.

Subscriber ID is a system defined unique identifier representing a Subscriber.

Subscriber Key is a user defined unique identifier representing a Subscriber.



- Import data (Wizard, API, Import Activity)


If you import to a list using the import activity, the system uses the List Detective tool to prevent bad email addresses from being imported.

If the file you are importing is encrypted or compressed, you can create a file transfer activity to prepare the file (decrypt or unzip) for import.

API methods are available to manage Lists and DEs.  They can also be used to add records to Lists, Publication Lists, and DEs.


- Segmentation

A group is a subset of subscribers.  Seems to apply to only LISTs (not DEs) There are two types of groups:
	Filtered Group
		A filtered group is generated by filtering subscribers by profile attributes, preference attributes, filters, and measures.

	Random Group
		A random group splits up subscribers from a selected list and places the subscribers into groups.
		
Measures:
	Use subscriber behavior to segment your subscriber base through Marketing Cloud measures. For example, you can find all subscribers who have opened 
	an email within the last 3 months.
	Available Measures:
		Bounce, Click, FTAF, Not Clicked, Not Opened, Open, Sent, Survey Response, Unique Click, Unique Open, Unsubscribe.
Data Filters:
	A Data Filter is similar to a group, except that data filters can be applied to Data Extensions and can include and/or statements. 
	A data filter will segment your subscribers on a list or a data extension, according to the criteria you set. For example, 
	you could use a Data Filter to find all of your subscribers on a particular list who own a car OR a motorcycle AND live in the state of Indiana OR Ohio.
	When sending to a data filter, segmentation is performed at sending. The send process may take longer because of it.

Query Activity:
	You can use a Query Activity to retrieve Data Extension data or view information that matches your criteria and use that information to 
	populate a Data Extension. A query activity uses SQL and AMPscript.
	You can create more narrowly defined Data Extensions based on other Data Extensions


Describe how to refresh segments manually vs. using automation.

	Automation - Group Refresh Activity: 
		Reapplies the rules in a group definition to create a subset of subscribers in a list.  
		For example refresh subscribers whose birthday is today.
	
	Manual - Refresh a Filtered Group:
		Newly added or modified subscribers are not automatically added to groups. 
		If the subscriber's profile or preference attributes would make the subscriber eligible for a filtered group, 
		you'll need to refresh the group so that the subscriber can be added.

	
	
	
	

- External Key is the unique identifier for the list.  This value is used by developers in their API calls to access the list programmatically.

- LIST ID is a unique integer value representing the list ID.  Not sure what it is used for...

- List type can be standard or public.  Public allows subscribers to see the name of the list on the subscription 
center where they can opt in or out of the list.


Web Collect: Is an online form you can host on any website to collect subscriber info to be saved into a list.

DEManager: Is similar to web collect but used to collect data to be saved into data extensions.

Smart Capture
Smart Capture is a tool in Email Studio you use to create lead capture forms to include in your landing pages. 
When a lead completes the form on the landing page and clicks the Submit button, the Smart Capture form automatically 
adds the information to the subscriber list, data extension, or outside data source such as an integrated CRM system.

Audience Builder
Audience Builder allows you to segment your subscribers in sophisticated ways to better target your sends.
An audience represents a collection of contacts grouped together based on attributes for the purpose of receiving a message.
Audience Builder can use any lists, groups, or data extensions linked through a common subscriber key or ID. 
You can add attributes to Audience Builder without dimensionalizing them. Audience Builder only supports queries performed via the expression builder.


Explain sharing data across business units.
https://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/exacttarget/enterprise/enterprise_20_overview/business_units/
A business unit is a hierarchical administrative structure that controls access to information and sharing of information. 
A business unit allows you to manage user roles for the business unit, view users who have access to the business unit, and define 
filter criteria for subscribers.
All items created in a business unit are accessible to all users working in that business unit. 
Items can be shared with other users in other business units by placing them into a shared items folder, located in the Content 
and Subscribers sections of the applications.
Business units manage the visibility of data within an account using a hierarchical structure, which can be organized in any way to match your business needs. 
Business units can mirror workflow processes, demographic and behavioral data about your subscribers, or your organization's operational structure.




Send/Subscriber Relationship.

A sendable data extension DOES NOT NEED an email address field!!  Remember, unlike Lists, DEs don't need an email address field.
Assume the sendable DE contains a field called customer_key.
You can create a Send Relationship between the DE customer_key and the All Subscribers Subscriber Key.
Deployments using the DE will send to the email address in All Subscribers
based on this join:
DE.customer_key = AllSubscribers.Subscriber_key


Assume a record is added to the all subscribers list and the subscriber_key value is "1234", and the 
email address is "user@domain.com" (remember both subscriber_key and email address are REQUIRED system fields when 
adding records to any list).
Now if my DE above happens to have customer_key value of "1234", then with the Send Relationship defined, sending emails using
this DE, will result in an email being sent to "user@domain.com" (even though the DE itself does not contain an email address field)
NOTE: Even if the DE did contain an email address field and it have a value of say "another-user@domain.com", the email will still 
be sent to the email address in All Subscribers ("user@domain.com") due to the send relationship defined.



Tracking & Reporting
=====================
Tracking -> Send: 
Compare high-level metrics for each message in a campaign and overall campaign numbers. 
The tracking results comparison feature shows how many emails were sent, how many were delivered, 
how many of the subscribers unsubscribed, how many emails were opened, and the number of click-throughs.
